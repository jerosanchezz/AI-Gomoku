# Gomoku-AI

This lightweight gomoku AI program is made based on a unique heuristic algorithm that would certainly provide the players with a new level of game-play experience. The AI is certainly not unbeatable, but it is equally good at attacking and making silly mistakes -- and this is what makes it more human like. It is capable of making outstanding moves based on an optimized minimax search algorithm that delves deep into the game tree while it is also capable of making simplistic mistakes due to imperfections built into its linear evaluation mechanism. This is precisely what makes this AI a playable opponent that is equally engaging and intriguing to battle against.

Features:
*five levels, each of which has a slightly different personality.
*simplistic UI design
*adjustable board dimension
*convenient retraction of a false move made by either the AI or the player at any stage of the game (even after the game is terminated)
*dynamic description of the AI's strategy
*comprehensive analysis of the game status that could be made available upon the player's preference
